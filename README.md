Tired of generic conversation starters? **Ice Breaker** is an intelligent web application that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized and engaging icebreakers for any individual. Simply provide a name, and our AI will analyze their professional background to craft unique questions that will spark meaningful conversations.

This project demonstrates a real-world application of the Langchain framework, showcasing how to build powerful LLM-driven tools.

## üöÄ About The Project

In today's interconnected world, making a great first impression is more important than ever. Whether you're networking, interviewing, or meeting a new colleague, a well-crafted conversation starter can make all the difference. "Ice Breaker" was built to solve this very problem.

This application uses a sophisticated pipeline to gather information about a person from their LinkedIn profile and then utilizes the creative power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to generate insightful and relevant icebreaker questions. It's the perfect tool to help you connect with people on a deeper level.

### Key Features:

* **Personalized Icebreakers:** Generates questions tailored to an individual's career, education, and interests.
* **LinkedIn Integration:** Seamlessly scrapes LinkedIn profiles for up-to-date information.
* **AI-Powered:** Utilizes a `Langchain Agent` with `Chat-GPT 3.5 Turbo` for intelligent and creative question generation.
* **Structured Output:** Employs a `PydanticOutputParser` to ensure the AI's response is always in a clean, usable JSON format.
* **Web Interface:** A user-friendly Flask application to interact with the AI.
